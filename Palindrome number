/*
    Palindrome Number Logic (Short Explanation)

    1. Negative numbers are not palindrome because of the '-' sign.
       So if x < 0, immediately return false.

    2. Store the original number in a variable so we can compare later.

    3. Reverse the number digit-by-digit:
         - Extract the last digit using x % 10
         - Build the reversed number using: reversed = reversed * 10 + digit
         - Remove the last digit from x using x / 10

       Example: x = 121
         reversed becomes 1 → 12 → 121

    4. Finally, compare original with reversed.
         If both are equal → the number is a palindrome.

    This method avoids converting the number into a string and uses only math operations.
